# The Westminster-Brussels Chart

## Introduction

**The Westminster-Brussels Chart** is an interactive data visualisation application that displays each Member of Parliament (or MEPs) of [the European Parliament](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/about-parliament/en) by parliamentary groups in a Westminster-style parliament chart, rendered in 3D with [WebGL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API). The Westminster-style chart is an apportionment diagram model, often used in British media to visualise the members of the House of Commons by political party. Written using Node.js and Three.js
